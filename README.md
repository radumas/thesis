# Web-version of Master's Thesis
Publishing the thesis for my dual Master's at MIT in Tranportation and City Planning in a  more accesible format while testing some web programming. I'm using [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) on a machine running `Ubuntu 14.04` for this project.

## Workflow
1. [Install Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/). In `Ubuntu 14.04` this required manually upgrading to `ruby 2.0` with

        sudo apt-get install ruby2.0 ruby2.0-dev
     
  then

        sudo gem install bundler
