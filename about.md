# Web-version of Master's Thesis
Publishing the thesis for my dual Master's at MIT in Tranportation and City Planning in a  more accesible format while testing some web programming. I'm using [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) on a machine running `Ubuntu 14.04` for this project. This is **work in progress**, which you can see [here](https://radumas.github.io/thesis). Until the libraries host the pdf, you can find that [here](https://radumas.github.io/thesis/raw_thesis/Thesis Final.pdf) (16MB pdf). 

All content is copyright (C) MIT (alas). If you fork the repo, please delete the contents of `_posts` and `images/media` promptly, since MIT does not grant you the right to distribute them.

You can see the workflow by reading the github repo [README](https://github.com/radumas/thesis/README.md).
